# 🏔️ a-HiKE: An interesting hike in the moutains of AI

## 🧗🏻‍♂️ Motivation
Artificial Intelligence (AI), as most people see it, is a very vast domain that requires a lot of mathematics and programming to achieve the cutting-edge smart assistants embedded in IoT devices that we all know. It is true that Machine Learning (ML) and AI are often mixed, for the average person only use AI through a computer but ML is only a small fraction of the AI field, making it even larger than people expect it to be. However, giving a good definition of what AI is nowadays is not an easy task. Experts in the subject dismiss definitions like:
> AI is the science which consists in making machines do what human can do.

> Every aspect of the learning process, [...], can in theory be described so precisely that it is possible to build a machine that can simulate it.

In favour of more precise and up-to-date definitions such as:

> Ai is the inter-disciplinary theoretical and pratice field studying mechanisms of cognition and reflexion as well as their immitation by a hardware and software device for human assistance or replacement purposes.

Since the first mathematical works related to AI in the 20th century, many other scientific domains have helped the development of AI. Biology has always been a source of inspiration since the first formal neuron in 1943, to more recent studies related to Computer Vision (CV). Physics and especially break trhough in semi-conductors technologies allowed for better computers allowing computer scientists to develop new programs and protocols to process and share data efficiently and cognitive sciences have taken an interest in AI and focus on the learning mechanisms.

Of course, many more domains influenced the way AI evolved during the last decades and vice-versa. Since the revival of AI thanks to the afore mentionned improvements of computers, the computer industry never stopped optimising products for AI workloads. As we can imagine, robotics is intrinsically linked to AI giving rise to Reinforcement Learning (RL). Currently, the vast majority of working area are being redesigned around AI technologies for better or for worse. Every tasks relying on signal processing (image, audio, acceleration...) for healthcare, manufacture, finance, cartography, defense and surveillance can be automated. Large language models revolutionised translation, software development as well as education and jobs based on image or sound creation are jeopardised by other generative models.

The goal of this repository is to achieve a better understanding of all the AI "systems" that currently exist from the most basic algorithms to the more complex models. Navigating in the different subfolders, you will find code and explenations for all the AI models I encountered in the course of my studies or during my free time.

I hope you will find this repository useful.

Enjoy the learning process! 😉
